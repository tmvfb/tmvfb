# Hi there, I'm Igor ðŸ‘‹
I have a master's degree in chemistry, and I am currently a student of Data Science & Management programme at Leuphana University. How did I end up here? I enjoy mathematics, programming and solving real-life problems by writing code! 
  
My goal is to become a data scientist, but I am also enthusiastic about creating backend solutions in Python.
