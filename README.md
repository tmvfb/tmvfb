Data Science student with over 1,5 years of experience in platform engineering as a working student. I am also enthusiastic about creating backend solutions in Python. 

## Short bio
* Honours master's degree in Chemistry from Lomonosov Moscow State University (2020) 👨‍🔬
* 2 years of work experience in clinical research (finance and clinical operations) 💊
* Currently 🎓: Data Science MSc at Leuphana University of Lüneburg, working on my data extraction- and GraphRAG-focused thesis
* Working at [prokube](https://prokube.ai/) on MLOps/LLMOps platform to make Data Science workflows easier 🛠️
  
How did I end up here? I have always enjoyed mathematics and data analysis — and I love solving real-life problems by writing code!
  
My current interests include understanding the whole data cycle in companies, from maintaining data infrastructure to data visualization. I also enjoy learning how data science and deep learning in particular change natural sciences and medicine.
  
By now, I have completed the following online courses:
* Data Science course by Yandex Practicum (10.2022 – 07.2023) ([certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18nasmZC3yutfiVHTZWv_6prl1smfY36V/view?usp=drive_link))
* Python web dev course by hexlet.io (10.2022 – 05.2023) ([profile link](https://ru-hexlet-io.translate.goog/u/tmvfb?_x_tr_sl=ru&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=ru&_x_tr_pto=wapp))
