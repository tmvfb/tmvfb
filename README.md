I have a master's degree in chemistry, I worked in clinical research, and I am currently a student of Data Science & Management programme at Leuphana University. How did I end up here? I've always enjoyed mathematics, data analysis and I like solving real-life problems by writing code! 
  
My goal is to become a data scientist, but I am also enthusiastic about creating backend solutions in Python.
