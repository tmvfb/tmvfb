**AI Platform Engineer working on ML infrastructure, model serving, and MLOps systems.**
I build the systems that bring machine learning from experiments into production.


I’m interested in the **infrastructure side of AI** — not only models, but the software and hardware that makes them usable in real-world environments.


## 🧠 What I do

I work at **prokube** on an AI/MLOps platform, building infrastructure and tooling that enables scalable ML and LLM workloads in production environments.

My focus areas:

* ML infrastructure & platform engineering
* Model serving systems
* MLOps / LLMOps tooling
