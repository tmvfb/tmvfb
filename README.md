Data Science student with over a year of experience in analysis and visualisation of industrial and scientific data. I am also enthusiastic about creating backend solutions in Python. 

## Short bio
* Honours master's degree in Chemistry from Lomonosov Moscow State University (2020) üë®‚Äçüî¨
* 2 years of work experience in clinical research (finance and clinical operations) üíä
* Currently a student: Data Science MSc at Leuphana University of L√ºneburg üéì
  
How did I end up here? I have always enjoyed mathematics and data analysis ‚Äî and I love solving real-life problems by writing code!
  

  
My current interests include understanding the whole data cycle in companies, from maintaining data infrastructure to data visualization. I also want to know more about how data science and deep learning in particular change natural sciences and medicine.
  
By now, I have completed the following online courses:
* Data Science course by Yandex Practicum (10.2022 ‚Äì 07.2023) ([certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18nasmZC3yutfiVHTZWv_6prl1smfY36V/view?usp=drive_link))
